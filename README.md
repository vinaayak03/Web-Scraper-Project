Web Scraper Project using Python

This project is a web scraper developed in Python designed to extract data from websites efficiently. The primary goal is to automate the process of gathering information, making it easier to collect data for analysis, research, or personal use.

The web scraper utilizes popular Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Requests. Beautiful Soup is used for parsing HTML and XML documents, while Requests facilitates sending HTTP requests to access web pages. This combination allows the scraper to navigate websites, extract relevant data, and handle various HTML structures.

The scraper is customizable, allowing users to specify the target URL, the elements they want to extract, and the output format (such as CSV or JSON). Users can modify the scraping logic to focus on specific data points, such as product prices, descriptions, images, or news articles.

Key features of this project include:

Ability to scrape multiple pages or sections of a website.
Support for pagination to extract data across multiple pages.
Structured output format for easy data manipulation and analysis.
Error handling to manage issues such as timeouts or missing elements.
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using pip. The main script can be executed from the command line, and it will prompt you to enter the target URL and other parameters.

This web scraper is an excellent tool for anyone interested in data collection and analysis. It can be used for various purposes, including market research, monitoring product prices, gathering news articles, or compiling data for academic projects.
